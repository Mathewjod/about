        <p>HelloI'm Ethen Mathew, a Computer Science Engineering student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, with a strong passion for AI, ML, and Data Science. I'm constantly exploring new technologies to sharpen my skills and aim to build a career in this field.
            
            I'm enjoying studying web development from Anju Miss and, alongside, I'm also doing courses of Web Development at my own pace. Although web development interests me, my true passion lies in AI, ML, and Data Science.
            
            I studied at Navy Children School from grades 1-10 and then attended Fiitjee for IIT-JEE coaching during grades 11-12. Though I'm a Malayalee, I grew up in different parts of India due to my father's navy service. I did my nursery and playschool in Lonavala (Pune), spent grades 1-4 in Port Blair (Andaman and Nicobar), and then moved to Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh).
            
            I'm curious, driven, and excited to contribute to the world of AI and Data Science.</p>
